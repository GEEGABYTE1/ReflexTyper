# Reflex Typer
Test your reflexes and your typing speed with this typing test on your terminal 💨

# Controls 

Input the number of words you would like to encounter when first prompted. 

The program will one by one prompt each random word and the user will have to type the same exact word back to prompt the next word. 

The goal is to type the prompted words as fast as possible with high accuracy 🎯

After typing back all the words prompted, the program will return a session summary including the average time taken, slowest time, fastest time, and average accuracy. Moreover, the program will also return a summary of each word in terms of time taken and accuracy. 

# Extras 

The Merge Sort was implemented for practice reasons. In this program, the algorithm returns the slowest and fastest time of the section.
